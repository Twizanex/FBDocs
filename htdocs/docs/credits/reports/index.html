<p>
<b>Please note:</b> It is possible to have multiple lines in your report for an order with the same transaction ID and/or order ID. This is due to several possible reasons.</p>
<p>One possibility is when a user has zero-value credits remaining in their wallet, but not enough to purchase an item. In this case, both zero-value and full-value credits must be used and the transaction could look as follows.</p>
<pre>
app_id  txn_type    txn_id  order_id    txn_time    settle_date value   credits
123456789   S   517433941473201975  9307560877689   2011-03-02 12:06:07 PST 2011-03-02  0.1 1.0
123456789   S   517433941473201975  9307560877689   2011-03-02 12:06:07 PST 2011-03-02  0.0 9.0
</pre>
<p>Another possible explanation for having multiple lines for an order is when the order is refunded. The following example shows what an order that was refunded one minute after the initial transaction should look like.</p>
<pre>
app_id  txn_type    txn_id  order_id    txn_time    settle_date value   credits
123456789   S   517433941473201975  9307560877689   2011-03-02 12:06:07 PST 2011-03-02  0.1 1.0
123456789   R   517433941473201988  9307560877689   2011-03-02 12:07:07 PST 2011-03-02  0.1 1.0
</pre>
<p>
<b>Payout Summary</b>
</p>
<p>The payout summary will be sent on the 5th and 20th of every month. It will contain a zipped attachment will all order details during that payout period in the same format as the daily report. In addition to the detailed report you will also receive a summary of the transactions for each of your apps during that payout period.</p>
<p>The summary email for that given payout period is formatted as follows:</p>
<pre>
app_id  app_name    txn_type    value   credits
13020537    MyTestApp   S   0.0 156.0

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>What is the process to ensure timely payout for an app that integrates Facebook Credits, as well as additional apps by the same company?</h3>
<p>At the registration stage, you will be asked to fill out financial information associated with your app. If you then integrate Facebook Credits in an additional app under the same company, you can make the association when you register that additional app.</p>
<p>Per the current Facebook Credits Terms, Facebook will issue payments to developers twice per month: one payment for activity between the 1st and the 15th of the month, and a second payment for activity between the 16th and the end of the month. Facebook will issue payments 21 days after the end of each bimonthly period.</p>

<h3>I am no longer under the publisher company that I originally worked with to onboard my app(s). How can I make sure that my monthly payouts are no longer sent to the previous publisher company, but a new company that I specify?</h3>
<p>In order to transition your apps to a different company entity, please give us advanced notice, so that we can ensure a smooth transition. Submit a request through the Facebook Credits Developer Support Form. In addition, previous payments should be reconciled between you and your publisher, per the agreement that you have in place.</p>
<h3>What fees does 30% revenue share cover?</h3>
<p>In addition to providing a platform wide currency and alleviating developer concern over fraud and customer support issues, here are some specific fees 30% revenue share covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payment processing and related fees for all payment options including high cost payment methods such as mobile, local and international gift cards, etc</li>
<li>Chargeback fees</li>
<li>Integration costs as we add new payment methods globally</li>
<li>Additional Facebook Credits that we give to users via bulk discount packages and special promotions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does the 30% fee take the above taxes into consideration?</h3>
<p>The 30% Facebook service fee does not include any local taxes applicable to Facebook Credits.</p>
<h3>What tax laws apply to virtual sales made through Facebook Credits?</h3>
<p>Tax treatment on sale of virtual goods varies significantly from one tax jurisdiction to the other, depending on the country in which a user makes a purchase with Facebook Credits in your app.</p>
<p>For example in EU markets, in general, sale of virtual and digital goods is subjected to EU VAT. Developers are obligated to collect and remit VAT on the sale of virtual and digital content to users who reside in EU countries, regardless of where developers are locationally based.</p>
<h3>How does Facebook equip developers to comply with the above tax laws?</h3>
<p>Developers are responsible for their tax compliance obligations, and it&apos;s up to you to determine how to report location-specific tax payments. We will provide necessary information about users: for example, by calling the Graph API getOrder method, you can get the country of the buyer for a transaction.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Facebook is not able to advise you on tax related matters; instead, we suggest that you consult and confirm with your company&apos;s accountant.</p>
