<p>Facebook Credits help developers who wish to offer premium in-game content generate revenue so they can focus on creating games rather than building payment systems. To do this, we have implemented these policies to help ensure that Facebook Credits are implemented consistently.</p>
<h2>Facebook Credits Terms</h2>
<p>
<em>Date of Last Revision: November 14, 2011</em>
</p>
<p>To enhance the quality, convenience, and security of the user experience on Facebook apps, these Facebook Credits Terms are included in the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/">Facebook Platform Policies</a> and apply to developers who accept Facebook Credits (&quot;Credits&quot;) in their application.</p>
<ol>
<li class="title">
<strong>Eligibility</strong>
<ol>
<li class="subtitle"> We may approve or deny your request to accept Credits at our sole discretion. We may also revoke your eligibility to accept Credits at any time at our sole discretion. If we reject your non-game app for use of Credits, you may accept payments in your app using another means. However, if we reject your game app for use of Credits, you may not accept payments in your app using another means.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You must be 18 years of age or older to accept Credits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="title">
<strong>Transactions</strong>
<ol>
<li class="subtitle"> You accept responsibility for fulfilling each transaction pursuant to the terms you offer. Our only role in your transactions is as a service provider.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may offer supplemental terms and conditions in conjunction with your sales, however they may not conflict with Facebook terms or policies.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You understand that transactions with minors may be voidable by law and that you may be required to refund amounts paid.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may not price items for sale in fractions of Credits.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may not conduct a transaction for which the promotion or execution is prohibited on Facebook.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may not accept Credits as payment for tangible goods including as payment for anything which may subsequently be used to acquire tangible goods, defined as any good that is physically delivered to a user.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You cannot have a cross-application virtual currency that can be purchased with Credits, so you may not accept Credits as payment for a virtual currency or other stored value item that can be used outside of the application where the payment was completed.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may not charge a logged-in Facebook user of your game app on Facebook a higher price in Credits for an item, virtual currency, or service than you would charge a logged-in Facebook user on another platform or on the web for that same item, virtual currency or service via another payment method.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may allow users to import to your game app virtual currency or items from your website or other platform that the user is connected to, but you must adhere to the following: 1) Pricing on Facebook must be the same as on your own website or other platform app for logged-in Facebook users, and 2) You may not incentivize logged-in Facebook users to make a purchase on your website or in an application on another platform, for example, by providing free or discounted goods or services that are not available to purchasers on Facebook.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may not price an item differently based on the user’s Credits balance.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> Except as a method of purchasing within your app in accordance with these Terms, you may not sell, trade or exchange Credits with any third party, nor may you enable or allow others to do so.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You must comply with Facebook Credits <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creditsbranding/" name="https://www.facebook.com/creditsbranding/">Brand Asset Guidelines</a>.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> Any items, virtual currency, or services you offer on or through Facebook are considered to be content or applications posted by you to Facebook under the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" name="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</a>. You may not offer any items, virtual currency, or services on or through Facebook that require the consent or other rights from any third party unless you have obtained all such rights. You may not offer any items, virtual currency, or service which would require us to pay any fee or royalty to any third-party. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of or related to your failure to comply with this paragraph.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You may not accept Credits in one application and deliver or transfer the purchase to the user in another application without our prior authorization. For example, an application solely designed to facilitate transactions is not permitted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="title">
<strong>Redemption</strong>
<ol>
<li class="subtitle"> When you redeem Credits with us we will redeem them at the rate of $0.10 per Credit, less a service fee of $0.03 per credit redeemed.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> When you redeem Credits you have accepted for a transaction, we will redeem them approximately 21 days following the end of the bimonthly period (either the 1st through 15th of the month or the 16th through the end of the month) in which the transaction occurred, except as otherwise set forth herein.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We will redeem Credits only in United States Dollars.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We will redeem Credits only if we have your current banking information or any other information we need to make the payment on record, including, if required,: identification, tax and business formation documentation. A list of our current payout methods is posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=198118756901516" name="https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=198118756901516">on our site</a>.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> At the time of redemption, we will round down any fractional amounts of Credits to the nearest whole number.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> If a redemption payment for any given pay period would be less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), we will roll payment over to the next month unless your account is being deactivated or deleted or if it has been one year since your first receipt of Credits or your last redemption payment.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We will only make redemption payments to the account entered by the developer in the Payout Information field of the Developer Credits <a href="https://secure.facebook.com/developers/company.php" name="https://secure.facebook.com/developers/company.php">sign-up form</a>.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> If we make a redemption payment to you that we later determine should not have been made, you are liable to us for the full amount of the payment and you agree to reverse the payment or permit us to reverse the payment.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You will not receive interest on balances held before redemption. Balances are not deposit obligations and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> If you wish to dispute a redemption payment, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of receipt of the payment. Failure to do so constitutes a waiver by you of any claim relating to the payment.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> From time to time, we may issue a small amount of Credits at no cost to a particular user (e.g. someone who is new to Credits or has lapsed from usage) in order to promote the use of Credits on Facebook and applications that use Credits. If you receive those Credits in transactions, we will not redeem them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="title">
<strong>Actions We May Take</strong>
<ol>
<li class="subtitle"> We may suspend, remove or disable access to any product or service you offer at any time without notice. We will have no liability for removing or disabling access to any such product or service</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We may limit the number of transactions or volume of Credits you are able to accept during a given period of time.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We may withhold from redemption any Credits we determine were accepted due to any breach of the Facebook Terms or policies by you, were transferred based on fraudulent or illegal transactions, were alleged by a user to have been transferred without their consent, or resulted in returned, undelivered, rejected or defective goods or services or transactions.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You will be liable for all Chargebacks relating to transactions we learn about within 90 days of the transaction. You will not be responsible for Chargebacks we learn about after the 90th day unless: (a) we determine you accepted those Credits in connection with a breach of Facebook rules or policies, or (b) your Chargeback rate for any one of the prior three months exceeds 5% of your total transaction volume for that month. By &quot;Chargebacks&quot; we mean any reversals of payment initiated by a third party payment provider.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We may delay redemption of any Credits related to any investigation we are conducting, but in no case longer than 180 days after the transaction.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We may deduct from your redemption payment any amounts for which you are past due to us on any payment in connection with any Facebook program.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> If we are unable to pay you because you have not provided valid payment information or, where required, identification information, we may terminate your ability to accept Credits and process any remaining balance in accordance with applicable law.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You agree to cooperate with us to prevent fraudulent or illegal transactions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="title">
<strong>Transaction-Related Disputes</strong>
<ol>
<li class="subtitle"> You are solely responsible for the resolution of disputes between yourself and users, including without limitation, disputes that Facebook refers to you or notifies you of via tools or systems we may provide. We have the right, but not the obligation, to assist in the resolution of such disputes.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You agree to provide us with any records that we request related to a dispute between you and a user.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You agree that we may recover from you any monetary loss to us on account of any decision by us to provide refunds or other compensation to users as a result of their purchases from you made with Credits or any claims made by third parties arising from your products or services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="title">
<strong>Other Terms</strong>
<ol>
<li class="subtitle"> You will not use or disclose any user information obtained by you for any purpose other than completing the transaction for which the user information was obtained.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> In the event of any conflict between the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" name="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/" name="https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms/">Payments Terms</a> and these Facebook Credits Terms, these Facebook Credits Terms control.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> You agree to notify Facebook in a timely manner if you receive any inquiry from a government agency about Credits.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> It is your responsibility to remit all duties, taxes (including, without limitation, sales tax and VAT) and other fees that apply to your transactions, including the redemption of Credits. Facebook complies with tax and legal informational reporting requirements in various jurisdictions. If you are a U.S. based Developer, you acknowledge that Facebook will begin, for tax year 2011, reporting to the Internal Revenue Service on IRS Form 1099K the gross amount of the payments you receive each calendar year if you (i) receive more than $20,000, and (ii) receive more than 200 payments, in that calendar year. To the extent that our issuance of a Credit is considered a taxable event and you subsequently receive that credit as payment for a transaction, or we otherwise remit taxes related to a credit you receive, you agree to reimburse us for any remittance we make related to that Credit. If duties, taxes or fees apply to the redemption of a Credit, the service fee may be adjusted by Facebook so that the net amount received by Facebook remains $0.03 per Credit redeemed. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of or related to your failure to comply with this paragraph.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> We can change these terms at any time without prior notice as we deem necessary. Your continued use of Credits constitutes acceptance of any changes. If we change the service fee or redemption rate, the redemption rate and service fee in effect at the time you accepted a Credit as consideration will apply to that Credit. We will give you 30 days notice on the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog" name="https://developers.facebook.com/blog">Facebook Developer Blog</a> of changes to the redemption rate or service fee.</li>
<li class="subtitle"> Facebook may assign or delegate any of its obligations and/or rights arising under these Terms without restriction.</li>
