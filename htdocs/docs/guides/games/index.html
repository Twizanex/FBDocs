<p>Developing games on Facebook Platform typically involves developing an <a href="/docs/guides/canvas/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas">app on Facebook</a>. An app on Facebook is ultimately a web application loaded into an iframe and presented from within the apps.facebook.com domain, appearing to users as if the game is served from Facebook.com. To get started creating your app on Facebook, please see the <a href="/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/">Canvas Tutorial</a> which will walk you through the basics of setting up and configuring your app on Facebook.</p>
<p>Games can also be created for or extended to <a href="/docs/guides/mobile/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/">Mobile Platforms</a> and take advantage of many of the same social channels.</p>
<p>This document will walk you through some best practices for designing and developing Games on the Facebook Platform. The goal is to educate developers on best practices and point out key features specific to building social games on Facebook:</p>

<h2>Social Channels</h2>
<p>
<a href="/docs/channels/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/">Social Channels</a> are a powerful tool for both increasing player engagement and new user acquisition. Take advantage of these tools for potentially exponential growth; if a user is enjoying your game make sure they have frequent and visible opportunities to invite their friends to play with them. These friends will then invite their friends and so on.</p>
<p>The first step is to become familiar with the different Social Channels available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/docs/requests/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/requests/">Requests</a> - A transactional 1:1 communication between a sender and recipient.</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/">Feed stories</a> - Allows the developer to post unstructured stories that will appear in a user&apos;s Newsfeed and Timeline.</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/beta/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/">Open Graph</a> - Allows the developer to post structured stories that will appear in Newsfeed, Ticker and Timeline Aggregations.</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/score/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/">Scores</a> &amp; <a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">Achievements</a> APIs - These enable developers to publish their users&apos; high scores and achievements for their app. These are built on Open Graph and get distribution via the same channels as other Open Graph actions.</li>
<li>Bookmarks - Once a user starts playing your game, we create a bookmark to enable users to easily navigate back to your game from within Facebook. These Bookmarks are available on the Facebook homepage as well as on the Canvas Page on the top right corner. Developers get these for free and do not have to do anything special to get access to this channel. </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the matrix below to compare the Social Channels and select the appropriate Social Channel for your use case. The terms are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>User Interaction</b> - the direction of communication: sender to single recipient or multiple recipients.</li>
<li>
<b>Visibility</b> - who can view the communication: only the recipient or everyone.</li>
<li>
<b>Value</b> - when to use the channel: acquiring new users or engaging existing users.</li>
<li>
<b>State</b> - whether the communication is permanent or transient.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on implementation details for our Social Channels please see the <a href="/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/">Canvas Tutorial</a> and the <a href="/docs/channels/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/">Social channels docs</a>. Next let’s focus on how Games Developers can use these channels specifically for Social Games by walking through some examples and best practices.</p>
<h2>Requests</h2>
<p>Requests are a 1:1 communication channel between a sender and recipient. Requests are always private and can only be seen by the recipient. Requests follow a transaction model - the sender is requesting some action from the recipient, that the recipient can accept or not.</p>
<p>Requests can be sent in 3 scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>The recipient is a <b>friend</b> of the sender and has <b>not installed</b> the game. This is considered an invite.</li>
<li>The recipient is is a <b>friend</b> of the sender and has <b>installed</b> the game.</li>
<li>The recipient has <b>installed</b> the game. In this case the sender and recipient do not need to be friends. This is extremely valuable for scenarios like <a href="/docs/#match" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/#match">match making</a> discussed below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Request has been sent, it will appear on the recipient&apos;s Facebook experience as indicated below:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/requests_notifs.jpg" width="700px" />
</p>
<p>Specifically the recipient will receive a notification, their bookmark counter will increment and they will see the Request surface on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/games" name="https://www.facebook.com/games">Games Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Next we will discuss 4 use cases for Requests:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="invites">Invites</h3>
<p>Social games are more fun when you play with your friends; it follows that invites from friends are a primary method for new user acquisition. They are implemented via Requests, more specifically a request sent from one user to a set of their friends who have not already installed the app. Facebook separates out invites from other requests and showcases them separately on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/games" name="https://www.facebook.com/games">Games Dashboard</a>. Invites are a great mechanic to drive distribution for a new game and help it reach critical mass as your users are effectively advocates of your game to their friends.</p>
<p>We have seen that Invites are one the leading source of installs for Games on Facebook. Some of the most successful games on Facebook Platform send on the order of 10x more Requests per user than smaller games. Developers should optimize the Invite flow and prioritize this experience to make sure they are getting the most out of this channel.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tips</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that the invite buttons are prominent within your interface. Users should never have to hunt to invite their friends. Most successful social games include an option to invite friends within the main screen of their UI, allowing players to invite their friends at will. Another common strategy is to maintain a friend bar in the UI which showcases a player’s friends and their current status in the game, be it a leaderboard, neighbor list, etc. These generally also include a button to allow a player to invite their friends directly.</li>
<li>Provide a filter in your Request UI that only lists users that have <strong>not</strong> installed the game. If you are using the <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/">Request Dialog</a>, you can enable this with the <code> app_non_users</code> filter.</li>
<li>For highly engaged players consider also prompting them during low activity areas of the game (ie. loading screens) and asking them to invite their friends. If users are having fun and enjoying the experience, periodically prompt them to invite more friends, but be mindful to not interrupt their experience.</li>
<li>Consider creating engaging mechanics when users visit their friends in game, or interact with them directly. For example, if the game supports the concept of neighbors you can grant bonus energy when a user visits their neighbors environment. If the players base was attacked, consider allowing friends to help repair it. Players generally find value in helping their friends progress, giving them opportunities to do so results in greater social experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>
<h3 id="turnbased">Notifications in a Turn-Based Games</h3>
<p>Turn-based games can use requests to great effect as a notification mechanism. When one player completes a turn they can send a Request to their opponent prompting them to complete their turn. This helps to keep users re-engaging with the game.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/taking_turns.jpg" width="507px" />
</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: Developers can streamline this process by implementing <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/#frictionless_requests" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/#frictionless_requests">Frictionless Requests</a>. Frictionless Requests enable users to send requests to specific friends from within an app without having to click on a pop-up confirmation dialog. Upon first sending a request to a friend from within an app, a user may authorize the app to send subsequent requests to the same friend without prompting for his permission. This works especially well for turn-based games where once a user has agreed to a match, then they can send requests for subsequent turns to their opponent without requiring additional confirmation.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/frictions_reqs.png" width="600px" />
</p>
<p>Best of all, they are extremely easy to implement. Just include the <code>frictionlessRequests</code> parameter in <code>FB.init</code> and set it to true:</p>
<pre>
<code>FB.init({
  appId  : APP_ID,
  oauth  : true,
  frictionlessRequests : true
});
</code>
</pre>
<p>This is especially effective for games that have a Canvas, Mobile Web and iOS implementations as the request will notify the recipient across all of their devices and create a seamless cross platform experience. For more information on how requests work across platforms, check out our <a href="/docs/guides/mobile/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/">Mobile Docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="match">Match Making</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that requests can be sent to any player that has already installed the game; a friend relationship does not have to be in place. If a user is looking to start a new game but none of their friends are active or available, the game can send a request to an existing player that is not necessarily friend with the current user. This allows the developer to increase the pool of their match making system outside the player’s social graph and works especially well for asynchronous games. You can simply use the <code>id</code> of the user when invoking the Request dialog like below.</p>
<pre>
function sendRequestToRecipients() {
  FB.ui({method: &apos;apprequests&apos;,
    message: &apos;My Great Request&apos;,
    to: &apos;499802820&apos;
  }, requestCallback);
}
</pre>
<h3 id="gifting">Gifting and Social Trading</h3>
<p>Gifts are a common use-case of the Request channel. Gifts are generally lightweight virtual goods (energy packs, vanity items) that can be used to re-engage players that haven’t visited in a while. Users can pre-select up to 50 friends using either the Facebook multi-friend selector or developers can create their own. For more information on the multi-friend selector, see the <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/">Requests docs</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: Create a custom user interface that allows users to easily accept outstanding gifts and send a gift back to their friend. This creates a feedback loop allowing users and their friends to easily remain engaged in the game.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/request_center.jpg" width="579" />
</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: Creating a custom Multi Friend Selector is a relatively simple exercise accomplished by using the <a href="/docs/reference/api/user/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/">Graph API</a> to retrieve the list of the current users friends and then sending the request via the <code>to</code> parameter as defined within the <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/">Request Dialog</a> docs. Building your own multi-friend selector enables you to customize it to your app so that the experience feels more consistent with the rest of your app. For example here are some experiences built by some of our top apps:</p>
<div class="clearcols" style="height:5px;">
</div>
<p>
<img height="250px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/invite_mfs.png" style="float:left;margin:10px 20px 50px 20px;" /> <img height="250px" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/invite_mfs2.png" style="float:right;margin:10px 20px 10px 20px;" />
</p>
<div class="clearcols" style="height:0px;">
</div>
<p>A more interesting implementation to Gifts is Social Trading. When sending a gift most implementations do not actually remove an existing items from the sender, rather a new item is spontaneously created for the recipient. This results in a lightweight social experience. To add substance to this transaction developers can introduce the concept of inventories and scarcity. When the sender gifts an item to a recipient, the sender has to send the item from their inventory. This add meaning to the social activity – resulting in lower frequency of sends but higher value to the interaction. It can be extended by players keeping public wish lists of items they require.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Feed Stories</h2>
<p>The Feed stories represents the users Newsfeed and Timeline. Stories posted via the <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/">Feed Dialog</a> will appear in the users friends&apos; Newsfeed and ultimately post to their Tieline, so long as they are both engaged with the game. These unstructured stories will not appear in Ticker. Feed Stories can be either one to many - the user is posting to their own Timeline or one to one - the user is posting to a friends Timeline.</p>
<p>Feed Stories contain unstructured data, essentially strings, that are customized by the developer. One notable feature of Feed Stories that differentiates it from the other Social Channels is the ability for a user to enter a custom message. This results in a more personal story and can lead to higher engagement from the user&apos;s friends.</p>
<p>Posting to the current users Timeline:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/newsfeed.jpg" width="700px" />
</p>
<p>Posting to a friends Timeline:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/newsfeed_directed.jpg" width="700px" />
</p>
<p>Next we&apos;ll discuss a core scenario for feed stories - Bragging.</p>
<h3>Bragging Stories</h3>
<p>A common use-case for Feed are “Brag” stories. These are intentional posts made on the users behalf when they have completed an activity of note within the game; anything from completing a quest, earning a new level or defeating a player. Bragging is a great use case that tends to drive a high level of engagement due to the competitive nature of games.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: As mentioned previously, one of the key features that differentiate Feed is the ability for a user to add a message to the Story. This results in a more personal story and can lead to higher engagement from the user&apos;s friends. Try to limit using Feed stories to interesting and note worthy moments within your game; these should be intentional shares that the user is invested in making it more likely for them to include a personal message.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Open Graph</h2>
<p>Facebook has recently updated the <a href="/docs/beta/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/">Open Graph</a> to support built-in and custom objects and actions. This feature is currently in beta and available to all registered Developers.</p>
<p>One of biggest differences between Open Graph and Feed is the ability to publish structured data. All stories must follow a &quot;actor verb noun&quot; syntax, such as &quot;Constantin conquered a universe&quot;. By using structured data developers can create <a href="/docs/beta/opengraph/define-units/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/opengraph/define-units/">Timeline Aggregations</a> that roll up these stories to highlight interesting patterns which become a permanent part of the user&apos;s identity on Facebook. These stories get distribution in the user&apos;s Newsfeed, Ticker as well as Timeline. In addition with Open Graph developers can provide translated text for their objects and actions in different languages enabling us to display these stories to viewers in their preferred languages resulting in increased engagement with the stories.</p>
<p>For an overview of the new features available, please check out our <a href="/docs/beta/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/">docs</a>. A great use case for both Feed and Open Graph is enabling apps to publish user generated content. We will also leverage this use case to highlight the differences between the two.</p>
<h3>User Generated Content</h3>
<p>A great use-case for the social channels is to distribute user generated content. Let’s consider a cooking game where a user can construct and decorate a dish. The player has spent some time crafting a unique dish that they now want to show off. Developers can use both Feed stories and Open Graph to show case and broadcast the results of the players efforts to their friends.</p>
<p>A Feed story can be used to include a custom image of the users dish and player submitted text describing their accomplishment. This results in the dish being shown to their friends and allowing the viewers to comment and like the post, helping to drive engagement and reward the player for their actions. This may get distribution to the player&apos;s friends NewsFeeds and will show up on the player&apos;s Timeline.</p>
<p>Similarly Open Graph can be used to share the dish, by creating a custom action <code>Cook</code> and a custom object <code>Dish</code>, which may be displayed on the player&apos;s friends&apos; Ticker and News Feed and creates the opportunity for some interesting developer created Aggregations on the players Timeline.</p>
<p>The main distinctions to these two approaches are:</p>
<p>Feed Stories</p>
<ul>
<li>These are unstructured.</li>
<li>They can contain any content the developer specifies, along with custom text entered by the player. </li>
<li>They should always be intentional where the user explicitly chooses to publish something and can control the directed audience. </li>
<li>Feed stories will show up on the user&apos;s Timeline but are transient and will not be permanent. The story will receive distribution in the Newsfeed and is viewable by users of the game that posted the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open Graph</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Graph stories are structured and must conform to the “actor verb object” model. </li>
<li>They are non-interruptive to the user&apos;s game play and allow the developer to create a live channel on Facebook for the most meaningful events happening in their game. </li>
<li>The story will receive distribution through Ticker, Newsfeed and Timeline.</li>
<li>Timeline Aggregations can be used to aggregate the data into interesting aggregations which live permanently on the user&apos;s Timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches are valid and the developer should weigh each option against their desired goals.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/ogvsfeed.gif" width="700px" />
</p>
<h2>Scores and Achievements</h2>
<p>
<a href="/docs/score/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/">Scores</a> and <a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">achievements</a> APIs are built on Open Graph and receive the same distribution points that all Open Graph stories do - Ticker, Newsfeed and Timeline. In addition to these scores and achievements also benefit from built in aggregations and stories that have been designed by Facebook.</p>
<p>Most games already use some form of scores and achievements in their games. These APIs give developers the ability to easily publish stories when users achieve high scores and achievements in their games, to drive engagement for their users and acquire new users.</p>
<h3>Scores</h3>
<p>The <a href="/docs/score/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/">Scores</a> API can be used to submit scores for any games that supports scores and/or a leaderboard.</p>
<p>When a user earns a new high score, a high score story is generated and displayed automatically in Feed, Canvas Ticker and the user&apos;s Timeline. Facebook also provides leaderboard flyouts for the scores landing stories as they appear in Ticker.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: Developers should supplement scores by also providing their own leaderboard that persists within the game and not rely solely on the scores stories displayed via the Social Channels. The persistent leaderboard encourages users to constantly compete with friends and improve on their scores.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>
<a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">Achievements</a> API can be used to define a set of achievements for your game and then award them to users once the criteria have been met. Games have a 1000 point allocation for all achievements and each achievement object must be allocated at least 1 point. achievements points are used to describe the value of the achievement in relation to all achievements defined in the game. The different achievement point values result in the following distribution effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-9 points – no distribution, though the achievement will display in Timeline Aggregations.</li>
<li>10 – 24 points – Ticker story with no image.</li>
<li>25 – 49 points – Ticker and Feed story with image.</li>
<li>50 – 99 points – Ticker and Feed story with image and additional distribution.</li>
<li>100+ points – Same as above with even MOAR distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the point allocation, all Achievements will be display in Timeline Aggregations.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: When designing Achievements consider the target audience. A key difference with Achievements on Facebook Platform is that both users and non users of the game will see these stories.</p>
<p>If the developer is targeting distribution, design around making the achievements as accessible to non users as possible. Creating an achievement that is so insular to the game that only hard core players would understand will likely receive very little click through from non users and be less successful as a distribution mechanic.</p>
<p>For developers targeting engagement, these guidelines are not necessarily as strict. In this case players may bond around a very specific and difficult to get achievement, so long as the criteria to achieve it widely known.</p>

<h2>Best Practices on Canvas</h2>
<p>In this section we will discuss some pro-tips to enable developers to build seamless and immersive user experiences within the Canvas.</p>
<h3>Only ask for the permissions you need</h3>
<p>When deciding which permissions your game needs to function, be conservative. Don’t ask for permissions that you don’t directly need to provide the base user experience. We’ve seen that the conversion rate for the <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/oauth/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/oauth/">Auth Dialog</a> declines proportionally to the number of permissions a developer requests when a new user installs the game.</p>
<p>Developers can always ask for additional permissions later. When asking for these permissions only do so when it is beneficial for the user experience and make sure to be clear as to how you will be using them. For example, <code>publish_stream</code> generally isn’t required for most games to function. However, if you notice that a player is frequently sharing Feed posts consider asking them if they would like to grant <code>publish_stream</code> for a more seamless experience. The player can revoke the permission at any time if they no longer find value in it via editing their app privacy settings. For this reason if you are using extended permissions make sure to verify what permissions you have access to when the user logs in.</p>
<p>To retrieve what permissions a current user has granted use the <a href="/docs/reference/api/user/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/">Graph API</a> and request the <code>permissions</code> connection.</p>
<p>To prompt a user for additional permissions use <a href="/docs/reference/javascript/FB.login/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.login/">FB.login</a> via the <a href="/docs/reference/javascript/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/">JavaScript SDK</a>.</p>
<h3>Create immersive gaming experiences with Fluid Canvas</h3>
<p>We designed Fluid Canvas to allow a developer to utilize as much of the Canvas page real estate as possible while maintaining the Facebook Chrome (header) and right sidebar (ticker). By utilizing this feature developers can increase the dimensions of their game and provide a full screen like experience. One major benefit of this approach is that the Facebook Dialogs (Feed, Credits, Requests, etc.) can appear seamlessly without the jarring user experience that occurs when using Full Screen mode.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/fluid_canvas_example.jpg" width="700px" />
</p>
<h3>Show engaging content when linking to your app in shared content</h3>
<p>When sharing content via Feed or Open Graph stories are created in the users Feed and Timeline. These stories can, and should, contain links back to your Canvas URL.</p>
<p>When new users click these links consider presenting landing pages that display the relative content that the user clicked on, and not immediately show the Auth Dialog. This will help create a more enticing user experience as it allows the user to see the content they were initially interested in, without having to grant permissions to an app they don’t yet understand.</p>
<p>For example, when creating <a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">Achievements</a> Open Graph pages make sure to provide a user viewable landing experience with artwork and copy that describes the Achievement in detail. When a friend clicks the “[USER] achieved The Great Achievement” story they&apos;ll be taken to this landing page as opposed to an install screen, allowing the user to find out more about the Achievement that they were interested in.</p>
<p>To determine whether a user has installed the app or not when visiting your Canvas URL, check the <a href="/docs/authentication/signed_request/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/signed_request/">signed_request</a> parameter. After you determine the state of the user you can take the appropriate action.</p>
<h3>Use setURLHandler callback to create seamless handling of notifications during game play</h3>
<p>The <a href="/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Canvas.setUrlHandler/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Canvas.setUrlHandler/">setURLHandler</a> method in the JavaScript SDK allows a developer to assign a callback method which will be executed whenever a user clicks a link that would direct them back to the current Canvas URL. For example, consider a user is currently playing “My Great Facebook Game” on Canvas when they notice a Request notification from their friend asking for help in “My Great Facebook Game”. Normally clicking this request would reload the page and reset the user’s current state.</p>
<p>If the developer implemented setURLHandler their callback method would be called, passing in the target URL as a parameter. This could then be used to transition the current game into a state to process the request. In the example above rather then reloading the page, the game could immediately prompt the user to assist their friend, a quick and seamless user experience.</p>
<pre>
function onURLHandler(data) {
  alert(data.path);
}

FB.Canvas.setUrlHandler(onURLHandler)
</pre>

</a>  </p>
<h3>Use Flash wmode=opaque to ensure good interactions with the Facebook UI</h3>
<p>If your game utilizes Adobe Flash, make sure to set the wmode attribute to &quot;opaque&quot;. This allows HTML elements to be displayed on top of the Flash content when on Canvas, allowing the Facebook notifications, ticker fly outs, Dialogs, etc. to display correctly.</p>
<p>If this attribute is not set to “opaque” or “transparent” Facebook will hide the Flash content if the user clicks on any UI element that will overlay the Canvas content. This results in a somewhat jarring user experience and should be avoided when possible.</p>

<a name="monetization">
</a>
</p>
<h2>Monetization Strategies</h2>
<p>Most games on Facebook Platform monetize through a freemium or Free to Play model and the use of micro-transactions, powered by <a href="/docs/credits/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/credits">Facebook Credits</a>.</p>
<p>Games can either implement their own virtual currency which can be purchased via Facebook Credits or use Facebook Credits as their in-game virtual currency directly. This virtual currency is then used to purchase various types of virtual goods. Either way developers can use Facebook Credits to monetize their games internationally via 80+ payment methods supported in 50+ countries around the world.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b> : Most developers are familiar with the default &quot;Credits&quot; implementation, but fewer developers are familiar with the &quot;Credits as a Payment&quot; flow, which might work better if you have already invested in your own in-game currency, or have other reasons for maintaining your own in-game currency (such as having a cross-platform app). You can learn more about payment APIs in our <a href="/docs/credits/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/credits">Facebook credits docs</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we list a few common examples of virtual goods usage in the Facebook platform.</p>
<h3>Vanity Items</h3>
<p>Vanity Items are in game virtual goods that have no direct effect on game play. Generally these are cosmetic items that can be used to enhance a players visible avatar, house, base, town, etc.</p>
<p>An important motivator for purchasing vanity items is scarcity or uniqueness. This can be enhanced by implementing limited time sales or limiting the quantity of an item sold. Should the item prove to be popular it can be re-introduced into the ecosystem at later points in the games lifecycle as a slight variant on the original item, so as to preserve the uniqueness of the original purchasers item.</p>
<p>
<img align="center" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/virtual_gifts1.gif" width="300px" />
</p>
<h3>Functional Items and Buffs</h3>
<p>Functional Items are the opposite of Vanity Items. These are items that can be purchased in-game that have a direct effect on gameplay - a faster car or more powerful weapon.</p>
<p>Buffs are consumable items (limited number of uses) that can be applied to a player’s game state increasing their ability to perform certain tasks. For example a Match Three game can sell an item that can be used once and increases a combo multiplier for the current session allowing the player to achieve a greater score.</p>
<p>It is important to think carefully about how to use Buffs in your game if you are building a skill-based game. It is important that buffs don&apos;t become the way to cheat but are a part of game play.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/virtual_gifts2.gif" width="700px" />
</p>
<h3>Session Extensions (Speed Ups and Energy Packs)</h3>
<p>These are items commonly sold in Social Games that increase session length or decrease the amount of down time between sessions.</p>
<p>A common mechanic is to limit session length by introducing a limited use but recharging resource. All actions performed in the game require some amount of this resource and once the player runs out they will need to wait for this to recharge, which happens slowly over time. Items can be purchases to give a quick boost of energy allowing the player to keep player during the same session.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/virtual_gifts3.gif" />
</p>
<p>Another common mechanic is to introduce the concept of real-time effecting the completion of activities. This is usually found in city management or empire building games where players need to train troops or construct buildings. The activity requires X amount of time to complete. If players want to expedite the construction they can speed up the process by spending a certain amount of virtual currency.</p>
<p>Setting a fixed number of moves or plays per session is another method to throttle player consumption of content and allow for monetization opportunities. This is a similar to tokens in a real world arcade. Each day the player receives X tokens. Once these tokens have been spent the player must return the following day, or purchase additional tokens to keep playing.</p>
