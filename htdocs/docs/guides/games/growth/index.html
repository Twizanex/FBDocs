</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<a href="/docs/channels/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/">Social Channels</a> are a powerful tool for both increasing player engagement and new user acquisition. Take advantage of these tools for potentially exponential growth; if a user is enjoying your game make sure they have frequent and visible opportunities to invite their friends to play with them. These friends will then invite their friends and so on.</p>
<p>The first step is to become familiar with the different Social Channels available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/docs/requests/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/requests/">Requests</a> - A transactional 1:1 communication between a sender and recipient.</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/">Feed stories</a> - Allows the developer to post unstructured stories that will appear in a user&apos;s Newsfeed and Timeline.</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/opengraph/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/">Open Graph</a> - Allows the developer to post structured stories that will appear in Newsfeed, Ticker and Timeline Aggregations.</li>
<li>
<a href="/docs/score/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/">Scores</a> &amp; <a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">Achievements</a> APIs - These enable developers to publish their users&apos; high scores and achievements for their app. These are built on Open Graph and get distribution via the same channels as other Open Graph actions.</li>
<li>Bookmarks - Once a user starts playing your game, we create a bookmark to enable users to easily navigate back to your game from within Facebook. These Bookmarks are available on the Facebook homepage as well as on the Canvas Page on the top right corner. Developers get these for free and do not have to do anything special to get access to this channel. </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the matrix below to compare the Social Channels and select the appropriate Social Channel for your use case. The terms are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>User Interaction</b> - the direction of communication: sender to single recipient or multiple recipients.</li>
<li>
<b>Visibility</b> - who can view the communication: only the recipient or everyone.</li>
<li>
<b>Value</b> - when to use the channel: acquiring new users or engaging existing users.</li>
<li>
<b>State</b> - whether the communication is permanent or transient.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on implementation details for our Social Channels please see the <a href="/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/">Canvas Tutorial</a> and the <a href="/docs/channels/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/">Social channels docs</a>. Next let’s focus on how Games Developers can use these channels specifically for Social Games by walking through some examples and best practices.</p>
<h2>Requests</h2>
<p>Requests are a 1:1 communication channel between a sender and recipient. Requests are always private and can only be seen by the recipient. Requests follow a transaction model - the sender is requesting some action from the recipient, that the recipient can accept or not.</p>
<p>Requests can be sent in 3 scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>The recipient is a <b>friend</b> of the sender and has <b>not installed</b> the game. This is considered an invite.</li>
<li>The recipient is is a <b>friend</b> of the sender and has <b>installed</b> the game.</li>
<li>The recipient has <b>installed</b> the game. In this case the sender and recipient do not need to be friends. This is extremely valuable for scenarios like <a href="/docs/#match" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/#match">match making</a> discussed below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Request has been sent, it will appear on the recipient&apos;s Facebook experience as indicated below:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/requests_notifs.jpg" width="700px" />
</p>
<p>Specifically the recipient will receive a notification, their bookmark counter will increment and they will see the Request surface on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/games" name="https://www.facebook.com/games">Games Dashboard</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Feed Stories</h2>
<p>The Feed stories represents the users Newsfeed and Timeline. Stories posted via the <a href="/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/feed/">Feed Dialog</a> will appear in the users friends&apos; Newsfeed and ultimately post to their Tieline, so long as they are both engaged with the game. These unstructured stories will not appear in Ticker. Feed Stories can be either one to many - the user is posting to their own Timeline or one to one - the user is posting to a friends Timeline.</p>
<p>Feed Stories contain unstructured data, essentially strings, that are customized by the developer. One notable feature of Feed Stories that differentiates it from the other Social Channels is the ability for a user to enter a custom message. This results in a more personal story and can lead to higher engagement from the user&apos;s friends.</p>
<p>Posting to the current users Timeline:</p>

</p>
<p>Posting to a friends Timeline:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/newsfeed_directed.jpg" width="700px" />
</p>
<p>Next we&apos;ll discuss a core scenario for feed stories - Bragging.</p>
<h3>Bragging Stories</h3>
<p>A common use-case for Feed are “Brag” stories. These are intentional posts made on the users behalf when they have completed an activity of note within the game; anything from completing a quest, earning a new level or defeating a player. Bragging is a great use case that tends to drive a high level of engagement due to the competitive nature of games.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: As mentioned previously, one of the key features that differentiate Feed is the ability for a user to add a message to the Story. This results in a more personal story and can lead to higher engagement from the user&apos;s friends. Try to limit using Feed stories to interesting and note worthy moments within your game; these should be intentional shares that the user is invested in making it more likely for them to include a personal message.</p>

<h2>Open Graph</h2>
<p>Facebook has recently updated the <a href="/docs/beta/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/">Open Graph</a> to support built-in and custom objects and actions. This feature is currently in beta and available to all registered Developers.</p>
<p>One of biggest differences between Open Graph and Feed is the ability to publish structured data. All stories must follow a &quot;actor verb noun&quot; syntax, such as &quot;Constantin conquered a universe&quot;. By using structured data developers can create <a href="/docs/beta/opengraph/define-units/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/opengraph/define-units/">Timeline Aggregations</a> that roll up these stories to highlight interesting patterns which become a permanent part of the user&apos;s identity on Facebook. These stories get distribution in the user&apos;s Newsfeed, Ticker as well as Timeline. In addition with Open Graph developers can provide translated text for their objects and actions in different languages enabling us to display these stories to viewers in their preferred languages resulting in increased engagement with the stories.</p>
<p>For an overview of the new features available, please check out our <a href="/docs/beta/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/beta/">docs</a>. A great use case for both Feed and Open Graph is enabling apps to publish user generated content. We will also leverage this use case to highlight the differences between the two.</p>
<h3>User Generated Content</h3>
<p>A great use-case for the social channels is to distribute user generated content. Let’s consider a cooking game where a user can construct and decorate a dish. The player has spent some time crafting a unique dish that they now want to show off. Developers can use both Feed stories and Open Graph to show case and broadcast the results of the players efforts to their friends.</p>
<p>A Feed story can be used to include a custom image of the users dish and player submitted text describing their accomplishment. This results in the dish being shown to their friends and allowing the viewers to comment and like the post, helping to drive engagement and reward the player for their actions. This may get distribution to the player&apos;s friends NewsFeeds and will show up on the player&apos;s Timeline.</p>
<p>Similarly Open Graph can be used to share the dish, by creating a custom action <code>Cook</code> and a custom object <code>Dish</code>, which may be displayed on the player&apos;s friends&apos; Ticker and News Feed and creates the opportunity for some interesting developer created Aggregations on the players Timeline.</p>
<p>The main distinctions to these two approaches are:</p>
<p>Feed Stories</p>
<ul>
<li>These are unstructured.</li>
<li>They can contain any content the developer specifies, along with custom text entered by the player. </li>
<li>They should always be intentional where the user explicitly chooses to publish something and can control the directed audience. </li>
<li>Feed stories will show up on the user&apos;s Timeline but are transient and will not be permanent. The story will receive distribution in the Newsfeed and is viewable by users of the game that posted the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open Graph</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Graph stories are structured and must conform to the “actor verb object” model. </li>
<li>They are non-interruptive to the user&apos;s game play and allow the developer to create a live channel on Facebook for the most meaningful events happening in their game. </li>
<li>The story will receive distribution through Ticker, Newsfeed and Timeline.</li>
<li>Timeline Aggregations can be used to aggregate the data into interesting aggregations which live permanently on the user&apos;s Timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches are valid and the developer should weigh each option against their desired goals.</p>

</p>
<h2>Scores and Achievements</h2>
<p>
<a href="/docs/score/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/">Scores</a> and <a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">achievements</a> APIs are built on Open Graph and receive the same distribution points that all Open Graph stories do - Ticker, Newsfeed and Timeline. In addition to these scores and achievements also benefit from built in aggregations and stories that have been designed by Facebook.</p>
<p>Most games already use some form of scores and achievements in their games. These APIs give developers the ability to easily publish stories when users achieve high scores and achievements in their games, to drive engagement for their users and acquire new users.</p>
<h3>Scores</h3>
<p>The <a href="/docs/score/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/score/">Scores</a> API can be used to submit scores for any games that supports scores and/or a leaderboard.</p>
<p>When a user earns a new high score, a high score story is generated and displayed automatically in Feed, Canvas Ticker and the user&apos;s Timeline. Facebook also provides leaderboard flyouts for the scores landing stories as they appear in Ticker.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/high_score_story.png" />
</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: Developers should supplement scores by also providing their own leaderboard that persists within the game and not rely solely on the scores stories displayed via the Social Channels. The persistent leaderboard encourages users to constantly compete with friends and improve on their scores.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>
<a href="/docs/achievements/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/achievements/">Achievements</a> API can be used to define a set of achievements for your game and then award them to users once the criteria have been met. Games have a 1000 point allocation for all achievements and each achievement object must be allocated at least 1 point. achievements points are used to describe the value of the achievement in relation to all achievements defined in the game. The different achievement point values result in the following distribution effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-9 points – no distribution, though the achievement will display in Timeline Aggregations.</li>
<li>10 – 24 points – Ticker story with no image.</li>
<li>25 – 49 points – Ticker and Feed story with image.</li>
<li>50 – 99 points – Ticker and Feed story with image and additional distribution.</li>
<li>100+ points – Same as above with even MOAR distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the point allocation, all Achievements will be display in Timeline Aggregations.</p>
<p>
<b>Pro-Tip</b>: When designing Achievements consider the target audience. A key difference with Achievements on Facebook Platform is that both users and non users of the game will see these stories.</p>
<p>If the developer is targeting distribution, design around making the achievements as accessible to non users as possible. Creating an achievement that is so insular to the game that only hard core players would understand will likely receive very little click through from non users and be less successful as a distribution mechanic.</p>
<p>For developers targeting engagement, these guidelines are not necessarily as strict. In this case players may bond around a very specific and difficult to get achievement, so long as the criteria to achieve it widely known.</p>
