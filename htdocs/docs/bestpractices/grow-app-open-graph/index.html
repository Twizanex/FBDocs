<h1>Guide: Complete the loop to grow your app with Open Graph</h1>
</div>
</div>
<p>The apps that are successfully using the Open Graph to drive discovery and distribution are those that create a complete loop by activating their existing user base to write high quality stories that drive engagement and discovery by new users. These sites engage new users to create stories quickly to keep the loop growing.</p>
<p>Here are a few helpful tips from some of the more successful apps we’ve seen.</p>
<h3>1. Start with your existing audience and provide them a good reason to add your app to their timeline</h3>
<p>The most important step in getting your Open Graph implementation off the ground is to get your existing users publishing stories. The sooner you have a large and engaged audience publishing content back to Facebook the quicker your Open Graph integration will drive discovery by new users and re-engagement with your app.</p>
<p>Look for ways to engage your existing user base to provide you the additional permissions needed to publish Open Graph actions to Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most effective solutions we seen have present users with an upsell on their homepage for their logged in Facebook users. An integrated look and feel make the upsell feel like part of the site, not an ad. <a href="http://pinterest.com/" name="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> prompts people to add the app to their timeline through a call out that is front and center in the user experience and well integrated with the design of the app. They also provide easily accessible links to additional content to learn more. <br />

</center>
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile apps can use notifications to encourage people to add the app to their timeline, as <a href="http://www.foodspotting.com/" name="http://www.foodspotting.com/" target="_blank">Foodspotting</a> does here. <br />
<br />
<center>

</center>
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give people information about the benefits of publishing to timeline from your application, such as the aggregations they will be able to share with their friends and the information they will learn about their friends using the app. <a href="http://www.gogobot.com/" name="http://www.gogobot.com/" target="_blank">Gogobot</a> provides clear direction about how people can control what is shared and with whom to help people feel safe and confident sharing. <br />
<br />

<img class="border" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/gogobot-benefits.png" width="90%" />
</center>
<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include images of friends who use the application through a <a href="/docs/reference/plugins/facepile/" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/facepile/">Facepile</a> or a list of friends who like the app to create a sense of community and trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize the number of steps a person must go through to add the timeline functionality by providing a direct link from the upsell to the permissions dialog.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Design your stories so that they are interesting and engaging in News Feed</h3>
<p>Content in news feed is ranked based on the number of positive signals – clicks, likes and comments - it gets from friends. Publish stories that will generate discussion or likes because when stories get likes or comments they get ranked higher. Include images or user messages to draw the attention of friends.</p>
<h3>Use images</h3>
<p>To help your stories stand out in news feed, include relevant images. We have found that stories with images typically get a significantly higher click through than stories that don’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose images that are unique and appropriate. For example, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/" name="http://news.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! News</a> includes a relevant photo associated with the article for each story the person has read. <br />
<br />

<img class="border" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/newswithimage.png" width="70%" />
</center>
<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid repetitive images or images not directly related to the content, such your corporate logo. People find this spammy and boring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for ways for people to include their own images in the stories they create. For example, <a href="http://www.foodspotting.com/" name="http://www.foodspotting.com/" target="_blank">Foodspotting</a> an app to help people find and share the food they love, encourages people to include a photo of what they are eating with the story. These images not only draw more attention to your stories, but also tend to get more clicks, likes and comments from friends, which will further boost your distribution. <br />

<br />
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Include personal messages</h3>
<p>We encourage you to publish all relevant social actions from your site. If your action includes text, such as a comment, or you have an explicit sharing action, such as rating a movie, capture and publish the user&apos;s message in the user_message field. When you publish the story back to Facebook, include the user message field and it will be passed through as part of the Open Graph story. This content shows up as part of the stories in news feed and is included in timeline aggregations. For example, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/" name="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, a movie review site, encourage people to not only rate a movie, but also provide review comments which they pass through to Facebook.<br />

<h3>3. Make it easy for people new to your app to start sharing + grow the loop</h3>
<p>The goal is to get the most new people clicking from Facebook to generate stories so that the cycle continues. Make it easy for a person who comes to your app through a friend’s story to find what they want and to start sharing their stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To personalize your app and to streamline the publishing of stories by new users back to Facebook, enable <a href="/docs/opengraph/authentication/#referrals" name="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/authentication/#referrals">authenticated referrals</a>. Authenticated referrals grants you the opportunity to build a personalized experience for Facebook visitors as soon as they arrive at your app. People can immediately begin publishing Open Graph actions, as they will have already authorized your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friends provide context and help the app feel more familiar and social. When a person clicks on a link on Facebook, Facebook passes you the id of the action they clicked on, so you can to show the face of the friend who produced the action. Bring them directly to their friend&apos;s action, such as a comment or review on the site, not a generic experience. Present the friend’s face and highlight how the friend is using the app. For example, when a person lands on the page of a book a friend has reviewed <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" name="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>, an app to help people find and share the books they love, points the person to the friend&apos;s review and includes their face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prompt a new person to produce actions by asking a light weight question that invites response. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" name="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>, encourages the person to rate the book or add it to the books they have read with simple star selector and button. Put the prompt directly next to the content on the same page. Don&apos;t bury the opportunity deeper down in your site where a person might not find it. <br />
<br />
<center>
<img class="border" src="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/nuxprompt.png" width="90%" />
</center>
<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a new user begins producing stories, drop them into a new user experience that encourages them to do things that will create additional meaningful stories. Once the person has indicated whether or not they want to read the book their friend is reading on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/" name="http://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>, they are brought to a page where they can rate a series of books they have read or want to read. These stories are written to news feed and the person’s timeline and the sharing loop begins again. <br />

</li>
</ul>
<p>These few small changes can have a big impact on the way the Open Graph helps to drive discovery and engagement of your app. We look forward to seeing what you build.</p>
